            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Poor French Refugees.</head>
            <p>THEY humbly ſhew, That they were graciouſly invited into this Kingdom, both by King <hi>Charles</hi> II's Declaration, bearing date <hi>July</hi> 28, 1681. and his preſent Majeſty's Declaration of <hi>April</hi> 25, 1689. This laſt is hereunto annexed.</p>
            <p>The Circumſtances of the Refugees being now much more deplorable than ever, their urgent Neceſſities force them to implore the bountiful Help of this Honourable Houſe, which is their laſt hope in their ſad Extremity, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tried all other means imaginable.</p>
            <p>Their Number amounted, laſt year, to 3300 and upwards, among which there were many Gentlemen and Gentlewomen, Miniſters and their poor Families, Widows and Orphans, whoſe Husbands and Fathers have loſt their Lives in the King's Service, and other diſtreſſed People, through Age, Sickneſs and other Caſualties: which Number is at this time much increaſed, by reaſon of other poor People, newly come from <hi>Switzerland</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> invited over by his Majeſty, to be ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that ſtay here through want of Money to ſend them over.</p>
            <p>Theſe Diſtreſſed Proteſtants, and particularly the Miniſters; whoſe Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Attendance to their Miniſtry do render them unfit for any other Work, are ſo much more worthy of Compaſſion, that the Edict which broke that of <hi>Nants,</hi> did command them to depart the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> within fifteen days, upon pain of being ſent to the Galleys; ſo that many are come away naked and deſtitute of Support. Moreover, many Perſons of very
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108414:2"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 53 -->
good Quality of both Sexes, born to fair Eſtates, and bred up accordingly without Trade or Profeſſion, after having been ruined by the Dragoons were forced to come over, where they have been invited to take Refuge.</p>
            <p>Theſe Poor Refugees, when they received his Majeſty's Charitable Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of about 1000 <hi>l. per Month,</hi> it was ſometimes given them in remote Tallies, which being exchanged for Money, yielded much leſs; ſo that if you take them one with another, each of them had not much above 3 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> to live upon, though their very Lodgings amounted to near as much.</p>
            <p>Being in that Condition, they have exhauſted, long ſince the Charities of thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> that were in any capacity to relieve them, and without which it is evident they had ſtarved; and though the ſame Perſons do, even now, all they can towards the Relief of theſe their poor Brethren, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, they have to aſſiſt both the Poor of their Nation-that were here, and thoſe Refugees that came into <hi>England</hi> before the Revocation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict aforeſaid, and alſo to contribute to the Poor of the ſeveral Pariſhes they live in. The Number of thoſe that came over ſince the ſaid Revocation, is ſo great, and their Wants ſo extream, that all the Maintenance they can afford them, bears no Proportion with the preſſing Neceſſity they are groaning under.</p>
            <p>To evidence further the extream Miſery of this miſerable People, they beg leave to ſay, That his Majeſty hath not continued to them the former Allowance of 1000 <hi>l. per Month</hi> theſe twenty Months laſt paſt, excepting only 2000 <hi>l.</hi> at the time he granted them the laſt Brief, which, together with the Sum of 1658 <hi>l.</hi> 16 <hi>s.</hi> given by ſeveral of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and other Noble and Charitable Perſons, with the Sum collected upon the ſaid Brief, amount to the Sum of 7305 <hi>l.</hi> 4 <hi>s.</hi> which cometh far ſhort of yielding any tolerable Suppply to the Needs and Numbers of ſo many Poor People, that have ſuffered the Loſs of their Eſtates for the Cauſe of the Goſpel: a great part of whom have no Linen to keep them clean, no Beds to lie on, and no Cloaths to put on.</p>
            <p>This their deplorable Caſe hath been expoſed ſo plain to the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Brief aforeſaid, that they certifie the ſame to be true. And as ſeveral Poor among the <hi>French Refugees</hi> are dead for want of Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſo many others lived only upon credit; and now their Creditors, even of this Nation as well as of their own, ſhall ſuffer great Loſs, if theſe Poor People ſhould not be put into a Capacity to pay their Landlords, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, Brewers, and others; ſo that they may expect the Hardſhip of a Priſon, which hath been the Caſe of ſome already. And there being no body that would truſt them for the future, they muſt needs beg their Bread in the Streets, and thereby lie under the Abuſe of the Engliſh Beggars, or be forced to ſtarve in their poor Lodgings, if they are not turned out of them by their Landlords.</p>

               <!-- PDF PAGE 54 -->
But after this ſhort Account, which even Neceſſity, Hunger and Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (overcoming Shame) draw out of ſorrowful Hearts, they declare that none pray for Relief but ſuch as are Superannuated, Sick, or Infants under the Age of ten Years, and ſuch Widows as have had their Husbands killed in this preſent War, or actually uncapable of any Labour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which is humbly offered to the Wiſdom and Charitable Conſideration of this Honourable Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE whoſe Names are under-written, being called by the Lord Keeper and ſeveral Lords to aſſiſt in the Diſpoſal of the Moneys collected upon the laſt Brief; do atteſt the Truth of what is above ſaid concerning it, and that we do believe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>French Refugees</hi> to be as deplorable as is herein declared.</p>
